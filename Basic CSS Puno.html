    One Mistake Ends It All</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(138, 138, 138); font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">  
        On the morning of December 19, we had an ESP quiz (20 items), 
        which I thoroughly studied for. I even created a whole mind map, which are like site-maps, on our whiteboard covering the entire lesson from the most to least significant details. I was really confident that I got a perfect score; however, I had ONE mistake. 
        What makes it even worse is that, it is one of those mistakes on an exam 
        you wished you did NOT change ðŸ˜¢. </p>
